# YOUR WINTER

In this project, you can share your location after visiting the page. The system will then check if it's raining in your region and if the temperature will drop below 1 degree Celsius.

This makes the user think it's snowing and they see it as a small map.

It works with a simple Open-meteo API where you get the temperature data or rainfall data.

### Why?
Why not? I love snow and want to know when it snows in my region.
